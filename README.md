# VR-Escape-Rooms

This is a virtual reality game developed in Unity. The project was the
semester-long "coding project" developed for CS 440: Software Engineering 1 
at the University of Illinois at Chicago in Spring 2020. It was developed by me, 
Krystian Stanuch, Patricia Guera, and Aakash Kotak. The purpose of this
project was to understand the Agile framework for software engineering,
specifically the Scrum methodology.

In VR Escape Rooms, the player must interact with different objects in each
puzzle room in order to escape. There are a total of four rooms; each room
made from one team member:

1. Bunker

>This level was designed by me. Since I was mostly in control of the virtual
>reality controls for this project, I made this tutorial level to introduce
>the player to the controls of the game. It consists of a small bunker room
>with some objects, including a door, that could be interacted with.
2. Cabin House

>This level was designed by Krystian Stanuch. Since this was his first time
>working with Unity, he designed a more basic room. The level consists of a cabin
>house to explore and interact with objects. It also comes with a story where
>a mad lumberjack has kidnapped you and you need to escape.
3. Living Room

>This level was designed by Aakash Kotak. We planned for each level to increase 
>with difficulty, so this room had more clues and objects to interact with. The story
>is that you are kidnapped and you have to look around the room for a key to escape.
4. The Lab

>This level was designed by Patricia Guera. The story is you are infected with 
>a disease by the mad scientist and you have to solve the puzzle to find the antidote.

To develop this Unity game, we relied upon the Virtual Reality Toolkit (VRTK) for Unity.
More info on the VRTK could be found [here](https://vrtoolkit.readme.io/). Despite this, we did not
have the resources to test this game out on an offical VR headset due to COVID-19. We opted
to use the simulator given within the VRTK to test our game and present it to the class.
